# StockPrediction
As a fun project, I tried to predict the stock market and implemented a small library todo so.
Basically, I want to use a sliding window of historic prices of several companies or funds and
predict the price of a single company. In the end, I achieve decent results in a 10 day window and
predicting 5 days into the future. However, my error is still several euros large :)
